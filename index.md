_Senior Staff Engineer_<br>
[Alibaba Robotics](https://www.softbankrobotics.com/corp/pressroom/20161013a/) was founded for localized operations of Softbanks robot called Pepper. I acted as leader of the Speech & Dialog team. My contributions were:
* Designed the architacture of light voice interaction system for robot.
* Optimized audio noise supporesion modules on Pepper.

### **LeTV, LeLe Innovation Subsidiary** `2015.12 - 2016.12`

_Senior Researcher_<br>
Worked on acoustic modelling for SR and voice wake-up.

### **Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Acoustics** `2014.3 - 2015.12`

_Assistant Researcher_<br>

### **Samsung R&D Institute of China, Languge Computing Lab** `2014.1 - 2014.2`

_Intern Engineer_<br>
Worked on optimization of TTS training pipelines.

### **Idiap Research Institute, Speech and Audio Group** `2012.9 - 2013.8`

_Research Intern_<br>
I was sponsored by Chinese Scholarship Council as joint Ph.D. at Idiap for a year, advised by [Phil Garner](http://www.idiap.ch/~pgarner).
